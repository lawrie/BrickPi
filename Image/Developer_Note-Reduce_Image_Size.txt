How we reduce the image size.

When changing an image around you may want to reduce the image size or cut out extra un-used space.  This is how we do it.

Using Ubuntu!

1.  Insert your SD Card in the Ubuntu machine.
2.  Open GParted.  Observe the number of sectors and sector size.
3.  In GParted, reduce the size of the active ext4 section of the SD card by at least 250 MB.  Be sure you're not reducing it past the used point of the partition.
4.  Calculate out the size of the partitions.  In Gparted click "View --> Device Information".  
5.  Note the number of sectors and the sector size.
6.  Calculate out the number of sectors for the new image.  Divide the size of the final image by the sector size to get the number of sectors to copy over.
7.  Run dd.  Be sure you pray beforehand.
8.  sudo dd if=/dev/mmcblk0 of=~/test.img bs=512 count=7000000
	This creates test.img in the home directory, with a sector size of 512, and a total img size of 3.5 GB from the SD card located on /dev/mmcblk0

That should be it!
